The Order
===

Of those who congregate under the sygil of tech, some few are chosen by the Fates to organize the meetups. 

These poor souls toil through the waning hours of the night or stolen moments of the day for the benefit of the many, reaping no benefit but the recognition of their peers, or the ocasional beer.

Them , who suffer are thus named ...in case you might need to reach a human that has a chance of knowing whats happening :)
