# Events

## Event types
* Talks
* Workshops

### Talks

Talks follow typical symposium format. Invited speakers present to an audience. 

We tend to follow the following guidelines, but not too ridgidly:
* start between 9pm and 9:30pm
* aim to happen on a friday
* 2 speaker slots of 20-30mins
* topics do NOT NEED TO MATCH
* MC should hush and welcome everyone, introduces each speaker before their presentation
* 10-20 min break
* post break, open floor for anyone hiring, 2min brief each (whom, to do what)
* explicit Thank Youâ„¢ to venue, speakers, and sponsors.

We are still a small community and these guidelines can vary widely based on circumstance, so the rules are not too hard set.

Usually, groups form to go for a beer elsewhere if the venue needs to close closely after, or the venue will be open for a while after the talks to allow for more networking possibly even to consume some sponsored beers or nachos.

### Workshops

Technical Workshops are as a rule very hands on. They tend to take longer - 3-6 hours and might have multiple tutors.

Some rough guidelines: 
* use a tool like tito.io for ticket management. Seats are always limited due to limited tutors.
* make sure there is good internet for participants
* power for laptops is mandatory
* venues might cost a bit of money, get sponsors
* sponsors can also help with amenities like food/drink/internet
* 3-6 hours - if > 3 hours, have a larger break for food/drinks
